The Yeast dataset contains information related to the localization sites of proteins in yeast cells. It is commonly used for classification tasks in bioinformatics and computational biology.

Here is the information for the Yeast dataset:

Number of Instances: 1484

Number of Attributes: 8 

Attribute Information:

    Mcg: McGeoch's method for signal sequence recognition
    Gvh: von Heijne's method for signal sequence recognition
    Alm: Score of the ALOM membrane spanning region prediction program
    Mit: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of the N-terminal region
    Erl: Presence of "HDEL" ER retention signal at the C-terminus
    Pox: Peroxisomal targeting signal in the C-terminus
    Vac: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of vacuolar proteins
    Nuc: Score of discriminant analysis of nuclear localization signals of nuclear proteins
    
Class Information:
The dataset consists of multiple class labels representing the localization sites of proteins in yeast cells. The class labels are as follows:

    CYT: Proteins localized in the cytoplasm
    NUC: Proteins localized in the nucleus
    MIT: Proteins localized in the mitochondria
    ME3: Proteins localized in the membrane excluding the mitochondria
    ME2: Proteins localized in the peroxisomal membrane
    ME1: Proteins localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane
    EXC: Proteins localized in the Golgi apparatus
    VAC: Proteins localized in the vacuoles
    POX: Proteins localized in the peroxisomes
    ERL: Proteins with an ER retention signal at the C-terminus

Missing Attribute Values: None

Summary Statistics:
The summary statistics for each attribute (except the class attribute) are typically provided in terms of mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. However, without access to the specific dataset, I cannot provide the exact summary statistics for the Yeast dataset.

Class Distribution:
The distribution of protein localization sites may vary within the dataset. It is recommended to examine the specific dataset to determine the class distribution for the Yeast dataset you are working with.

The Yeast dataset is commonly used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the localization site of proteins based on the given attributes.
