The Glass dataset contains information about different types of glass samples. The dataset is often used for classification tasks to predict the type of glass based on various attributes.

Here is the information for the Glass dataset:

Number of Instances: 214

Number of Attributes: 9 
Attribute Information:

    Refractive index
    Sodium (Na) content
    Magnesium (Mg) content
    Aluminum (Al) content
    Silicon (Si) content
    Potassium (K) content
    Calcium (Ca) content
    Barium (Ba) content
    Iron (Fe) content

Class Information:
The dataset consists of multiple glass types, represented by the following class labels:

    building_windows_float_processed
    building_windows_non_float_processed
    vehicle_windows_float_processed
    vehicle_windows_non_float_processed (none in this dataset)
    containers
    tableware
    headlamps

Missing Attribute Values: None

Summary Statistics:
The summary statistics for each attribute (except the class attribute) are typically provided in terms of mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. However, without access to the specific dataset, I cannot provide the exact summary statistics for the Glass dataset.

Class Distribution:
The distribution of glass types may vary within the dataset. It is recommended to examine the specific dataset to determine the class distribution for the Glass dataset you are working with.

The Glass dataset is commonly used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the type of glass based on the given attributes.
