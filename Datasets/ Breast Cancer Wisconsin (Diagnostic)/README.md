The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass. The dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks to diagnose breast cancer as malignant or benign.

Here is the information for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset:

Number of Instances: 569

Number of Attributes: 32 (including the class attribute)

Attribute Information:

Summary Statistics:
The summary statistics for each attribute (mean, standard error, and extreme values) are typically provided. However, without access to the specific dataset, I cannot provide the exact summary statistics for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

Class Distribution: Approximately 62.7% of the instances are diagnosed as benign (class B), and approximately 37.3% are diagnosed as malignant (class M).

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is commonly used to train machine learning models for breast cancer diagnosis and prediction. The goal is to accurately classify breast masses as malignant or benign based on the provided features.
