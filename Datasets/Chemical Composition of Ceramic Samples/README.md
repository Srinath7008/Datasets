The goal of this dataset is to classify ceramic samples based on their chemical composition, specifically from energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) data. The dataset includes information about the ceramic type, whether it is part of the body or glaze, and the percentages or parts per million (ppm) of various chemical elements present in the ceramics.
