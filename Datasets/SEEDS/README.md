The Seeds dataset contains measurements of various features of wheat seeds. The dataset is often used in pattern recognition and classification tasks.

Here is the information for the Seeds dataset:

Number of Instances: 210

Number of Attributes: 7 (including the class attribute)

Attribute Information:

    Area A
    Perimeter P
    Compactness C = 4piA/P^2
    Length of kernel
    Width of kernel
    Asymmetry coefficient
    Length of kernel groove

Class Information:
The dataset consists of three classes, representing different types of wheat seeds:

    Kama
    Rosa
    Canadian

Missing Attribute Values: None

Summary Statistics:
The summary statistics for each attribute (except the class attribute) are typically provided in terms of mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. However, without access to the specific dataset, I cannot provide the exact summary statistics for the Seeds dataset.

Class Distribution:
The dataset is divided approximately equally among the three classes, with each class representing around one-third of the instances.

The Seeds dataset is commonly used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the type of wheat seed based on the given attributes.
